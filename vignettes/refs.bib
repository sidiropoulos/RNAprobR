abstract = {We implement a unique strategy for single molecule counting termed stochastic labeling, where random attachment of a diverse set of labels converts a population of identical DNA molecules into a population of distinct DNA molecules suitable for threshold detection. The conceptual framework for stochastic labeling is developed and experimentally demonstrated by determining the absolute and relative number of selected genes after stochastically labeling approximately 360,000 different fragments of the human genome. The approach does not require the physical separation of molecules and takes advantage of highly parallel methods such as microarray and sequencing technologies to simultaneously count absolute numbers of multiple targets. Stochastic labeling should be particularly useful for determining the absolute numbers of RNA or DNA molecules in single cells.},

@article{Kielpinski2014,
abstract = {Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting (HRF) is a tried-and-tested method for analysis of the tertiary structure of RNA and for identification of protein footprints on RNA. The hydroxyl radical reaction breaks accessible parts of the RNA backbone, thereby allowing ribose accessibility to be determined by detection of reverse transcriptase termination sites. Current methods for HRF rely on reverse transcription of a single primer and detection by fluorescent fragments by capillary electrophoresis. Here, we describe an accurate and efficient massive parallel-sequencing-based method for probing RNA accessibility with hydroxyl radicals, called HRF-Seq. Using random priming and a novel barcoding scheme, we show that HRF-Seq dramatically increases the throughput of HRF experiments and facilitates the parallel analysis of multiple RNAs or experimental conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that HRF-Seq data for the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA correlates well with the ribose accessible surface area as determined by X-ray crystallography and have a resolution that readily allows the difference in accessibility caused by exposure of one side of RNA helices to be observed.},
